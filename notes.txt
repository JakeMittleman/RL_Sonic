This may present a problem that we need to keep track of:

"A possible problem is that the same structural innovation will receive different innovation numbers in the same
generation if it occurs by chance more than once. However, by keeping a list of the innovations that occurred in
the current generation, it is possible to ensure that when the same structure arises more than once through
independent mutations in the same generation, each identical mutation is assigned the
same innovation number. Thus, there is no resultant explosion of innovation numbers."

Node Genes:

I'm unsure of how this should be implemented. The paper says node genes provide a list of inputs, hidden, and output
nodes. The video the guy just keeps this an enum of its type. Honestly the way he does it in the video makes more
sense to me. He has the genome store a list of edges and a list of nodes (like a graph). The paper has it a little weird.
I'm in favor of doing it like in the video but if you think we should stick solely to how it is in the paper I feel
fine with that.

Speciation (creating new species):

"The distance measure δ allows us to speciate using a compatibility threshold δt.
An ordered list of species is maintained. In each generation, genomes are sequentially
placed into species. Each existing species is represented by a random genome inside
the species from the previous generation. A given genome g in the current generation is
placed in the first species in which g is compatible with the representative genome of
that species. This way, species do not overlap.
If g is not compatible with any existing
species, a new species is created with g as its representative."

Page 13 of paper has a fitness formula that seems important but i'm not sure where to put it.
